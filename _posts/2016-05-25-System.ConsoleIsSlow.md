**This post is written more as a warning**

Anyone who made any [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) problems considering performance has seen this phrase in the assignment: "watch out for slow IO".<br/>
We are used to thing about files, databases and such as potentially slow IO, but the Console?<br/>
Yes, and you will be amazed how much.

Couple words about the setup.<br/>
I am using NLog with [file target](https://github.com/nlog/NLog/wiki/File-target) (for normal logging) and [mail target](https://github.com/nlog/NLog/wiki/Mail-target) (for total failure, and aggregated reports).<br/>
When debugging or profiling I run the process as a console application, so I have a [NLog console target](https://github.com/NLog/NLog/wiki/Console-target). It outputs some basic info and debug messages summing up to exactly 329KB of text.

So here are the numbers of running the application with console target:

![](/data/System.ConsoleIsSlow/BaseRun.png)

And here are the numbers with console target commented:

![](/data/System.ConsoleIsSlow/WithoutConsole.png)

28 seconds for outputting 329 KB of text. <br/>
To be fair, if you output it in one big chunk it will be faster.

**To sum it up:**

- don't assume something is fast. Measure it!<br/>
- control your output. If this was a program running normally as a console application with `Console.WriteLine` thrown all over the code base the change wouldn't take less than 1 minute.
- NLog is a good abstraction over where your logs go.
