One of the steps in cookit is calculating similar recipes.
This is what you can see on the left on the recipe page like [this](https://cookit.pl/przepis/350106/Karkowka+marynowana+w+mleku+i+cebuli+%E2%80%93+grill)

For the sake of clarity and manageability it's scheduled as separate Hangfire jobs. Because cookit is running 5 workers, so similarities are calculated for 5 websites concurrently.<br/>
The process uses [cosine similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity), so it allocates a huge list at start and calculates similarities. A very CPU heavy operation.

So some time after triggering all recipes recalculation I saw this in Hangfire console.

The process can take a while, but on average it lasts couple of minutes.
First thing was to check was if the server was doing anything. So fire up Task Manager and here it is:

So, something is happening. To better know what, I've fired up [Process Explorer](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/processexplorer.aspx)(run it as administrator!) and in the **Properties > .NET Performance** tab I saw this.

*A side note.<br/>
Process Explorer is an element of [Sysinternals Suite](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb842062.aspx). This is **the must have** for any developer using Windows. They don't need installation and weight less than 16MB. I always place them under C:\tools* 
  

I really like this tab, because it shows all the main performance counters for .NET programs.
And in this case it also worked. Spending 43% (in the peeks) in GC is **not** a good thing.

Just to be sure that high GC isn't caused by another issue, like exceptions let's look at **.NET CLR Exceptions** tab:

![](/data/GC-can-kill-You-Practical-GC-performance-counters-in-NET/ProcessExplorer_Exceptions.png)

More than I would want, but:

- those are all exceptions thrown during the lifetime of the process and earlier it has done some extraction jobs and they can cause exceptions.
- **those are also first level exceptions**. So also the caught ones. Some libraries use exceptions as way to control logic, and this can be seen on this tab. It can be a major performance hit.
- under heavy load [Hangfrie](http://hangfire.io/) can throw some sql timeout exceptions.

Process Explorer only shows snapshots. To see how it looks over time fire up Performance  Monitor (perfmon.exe - it is installed on every Windows) and add **.NET CLR Memory % Time in GC** performance counter (using the green plus).

![](/data/GC-can-kill-You-Practical-GC-performance-counters-in-NET/PerformanceMonitor_01.png)

Well it looks really bad. To say the least.<br/>
This only gives a very high level view. To have a better look let's add more performance counters:

- .NET CLR Memory # Gen 0 Collections (how many times **Gen 0, Gen 1 and Gen 2** collection was called. **It is a sum of all Gen collections count not only Gen 0**)
- .NET CLR Memory \ # Gen 1 Collections (Sum of Gen 1 and Gen 2 collections called.)
- .NET CLR Memory \ # Gen 2 Collections
- .NET CLR Memory \ % Time in GC

and we see this: 

![](/data/GC-can-kill-You-Practical-GC-performance-counters-in-NET/PerformanceMonitor_02.png)

So a lot of Gen 0 and Gen 1 collections, plus a little bit of Gen 2.<br/>
This is showing that .NET is under memory pressure and it's trying to free memory. Because it's not running a lot of Gen 2 collections means that enough memory is being freed during Gen 0 and 1.<br/>
To be sure lets see how big Gen 0 and 1 heaps are (how much memory is allocated on them), and how they behave over time. Lets have a look at those counters:

- .NET CLR Memory \ # Gen 0 heap size
- .NET CLR Memory \ # Gen 1 heap size
- .NET CLR Memory \ # Gen 2 heap size

![](/data/GC-can-kill-You-Practical-GC-performance-counters-in-NET/PerformanceMonitor_03.png)

This **almost** what I expect how the process would use memory:

- It allocates a huge list at start (the Gen 0)
- It loops through every recipe, calculates similarity, and stores it in a sorted list. The list is limited to five top similarities. So a lot of objects are being moved into and from the list.

So were is the **almost**?<br/>
Most allocated object should have a short life span, so they should be collected cheaply in Gen 0. But because Gen 1 is this big it means that when GC is triggered it can't collect them, so they are being moved to Gen 1. Then Gen 1 collection is being triggered, and previously moved objects are being collected. And Gen 1 collection is far more costly. In summary GC is being triggered too often.

To show my point where is the Performance Monitor with only one worker.

![](/data/GC-can-kill-You-Practical-GC-performance-counters-in-NET/PerformanceMonitor_04.png)

You may be wondering where is the Gen 1 line?<br/>
It is still there. It's those few pixels just above the 0 line is the Gen 1 heap size. And this is the same scale as plot above.<br/>
To make a point I've added time in GC.<br/>
A very boring plot. Just as it should be. 

But this only shows the problem. Possible solutions are:

- *Get a better machine with more RAM.* This is out of the question, as I already explain [why cookit runs on crap](http://indexoutofrange.com/The-importance-of-running-on-crapp/)
- *Have one worker.* This is also not a good solutions because some jobs are I/O (network) bound. And having one worker is in general not that good (anyone remembers 1 core processors?)

So how to have differentiate the number of workers in Hangfie?<br/>
This will be in the next post :)
