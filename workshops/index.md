## General information

My workshops are built around a simple loop:

1. Present the code or design.
2. Do You see a problem with it?
3. Define the problem.
4. Define the simplest and best value to effort step You can take.   
5. Apply.
6. Is it OK now? If no, go back to point 3.

This approach doesn't teach definitions but **a way of analyzing and applying solutions to the problem**. What attendees learn can be used not only in a brand new greenfield project but everywhere. 

## Key qualities of my workshops:

- Very hands on heavy.
- My goal is for attendees to **understand the problem and the path to the solution**. Not just to teach empty definitions.
- Individual approach to each attendee.
- Solving real-life problems.
- Applicability of gained knowledge.

# FAQ:

## Q: Why Your workshops last 3 days?

**A:** From my experience, this is the optimum length. That said, most workshops can be scaled down to two days by limiting the scope. I recommend a 3-day option.

## Q: Can we do a 3-day workshop in 2 days or less?

**A:** The group dictates the workshop paste. If they solve the exercises in groundbreaking time, I have additional ones ready. **My goal is to teach people, not just check off topics. This takes some time.**

## Q: Why do you have so little theory? Isn't explaining something better than tacking it head first? 

**A:** The fact that I have so little lecture time doesn't mean that I don't give the theoretical background. I just don't do it in a form of a lecture. There are better ways and I'm using them.
