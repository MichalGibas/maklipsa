## Short abstract

Serverless is THE WORD, and like all its predecessors it has become overloaded and simplified to just Azure Function/AWS Lambda/GCP Cloud Functions depending what Your camp is. But serverless started way earlier, and not with code execution. Serverless is not only how to execute code, but how to **design** applications in a truly cloud way. We will look into cloud offerings that can be used for serverless architecture, the pitfalls and gains of different approaches mostly concentrating on Microsoft Azure.
