## Short abstract

Serverless is the word in IT in 2018, but as all its predecessors it has become overloaded and simplified. Serverless is way more than Azure Function, AWS Lambda, or GCP Cloud Functions. It is not only how to execute code, but how to design applications in a truly cloud way. This session will look how to design serverless application, what components to use, the pitfalls and gains of different approaches mainly, but not only, concentrating on Microsoft Azure.
