## Short abstract

We all agree that infrastructure as code is a must and every cloud provider gives a way to create the whole environment from a text file. So everything is fine? Until you see those files and see how usable they are. This is where Terraform steps in. A simple and expressive way to have cloud as code.

## Description

We all agree that infrastructure as code is a good thing or even a must. It is also acknowledged by every cloud provider since all of them give a way to script and create the whole environment from a text file. So everything is fine? Those who used Azure Resource Manager (or its counterpart) know the pain of configuration files with thousands of lines of code. This is where Terraform steps in. A simple, clean and expressive way to express cloud architecture as code and track changes. We will look at its features, limitations, how it works and how to start working with it and Microsoft Azure.
