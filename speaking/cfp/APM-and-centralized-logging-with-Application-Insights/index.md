## Short abstract

With 45 developers we have been developing and supporting a big distributed system, so I know the pains of remote desktop and, later, a self-hosted Kibana and Graphite. 
See how Application Insights made a lot of this pain go away and in a cost effective way.

## Description

This talk is based on my experience in using Azure Application Insights in multiple use cases. From big systems, through pet projects to a temporary debugging and diagnostics tool.

It will introduce the audience to:

- the building blocks of Application Insights monitoring 
- log querying
- custom metrics
- alerting
- browser and server metrics
- diagnostics
- pricing and cost control
- gotchas and troubleshooting

I will also look at what is being offered by the competition and why I choose Application Insights even when paying from my own pocket.
